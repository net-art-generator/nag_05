This version of the net.art generator creates images. The resulting image 
emerges as a collage of a number of images which have been collected on
the WWW in relation to the 'title' you have chosen. The original material 
is processed in 12-14 randomly chosen and combined steps. The net.art generator 
was programmed by Panos Galanis from IAP GmbH,Hamburg, and was a commission by 
the Volksfürsorge art collection. If you are facing serious problems and 
the generator does not work at all,please contact Panos pg@iap.de, 
or Cornelia cornelia@snafu.de
